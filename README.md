Python calculator for clinical nutrition

A simple application built using Tkinter (and now Kivy) to
compute caloric needs using Mifflin-St. Jeor or Penn-State
equations (where applicable). It also provides the ability
to enter antropometrics in non-similar units if needed, i.e.
weight in kilograms and height in inches. Finally, additional
useful information is provided such as the antropometrics
converted into the opposite unit, Body Mass Index, Ideal Body
Weight, Adjusted Body Weight and calories per kilogram.
